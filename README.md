### Installation

Install this library in a `virtualenv` using pip. `virtualenv` is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With `virtualenv`, it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.
